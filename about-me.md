My name is Ben Robison. I work for Adobe as a Product Manager figuring out how to help content publishers survive the digital revolution.

I love cars, gadgets, technology, music, &amp; books.  I am a PC and a Mac.  And an Android if that's a thing.  I've been married the lovely Alison for 10 years.  We've got 4 kids, she's thinking about a 5th, with daily debates and 2nd thoughts ensuing.

<strong>About My Blog</strong>
My blog got its start as a learning journal of sorts. I had a professor at BYU that required us to blog for class. This was a substitute for regular homework assignments and I was a huge fan of this approach. It started with little research projects that we would do on our own time and write about what we learned. This worked really well for me.

From there it expanded into writing about the other things that I love. Sometimes I scour the dark corners of the Internet to find out how to do certain things and blog about them to save others the effort. Sometimes I write about ideas I have, things that I think are interesting or funny, and sometimes I just rant.  My opinions are my own.
