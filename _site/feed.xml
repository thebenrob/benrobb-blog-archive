Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1 - Get a Federal EIN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started on the State of Utah’s website, but immediately discovered I needed a Federal EIN, so I’d recommend you start there first.  You get this from the IRS website at: https://sa.www4.irs.gov/modiein/individual/index.jsp&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First read the intructions, decide if you need an EIN and if so, begin the application.  Next step is to choose the type.  I want to run a business that has separate finances from my personal finances in order to protect my personal assets from business liabilities.  Based on my understanding, Sole Proprietor and Partnerships were not going to meet my needs, and I chose a Limited Liability Company or LLC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the process is pretty self-explanatory.  There’s a part where you can choose to file extra paperwork in order to have your LLC move to Corporation or S-Corp status.  I chose neither.  You fill in some personal information, and then get a PDF document that contains your EIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2 - Register with the State&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utah’s starts with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://secure.utah.gov/osbr-user/dashboard.html&quot;&gt;OneStop Online Business Registration&lt;/a&gt;.  You’ll have to create an account if you don’t already have one.  This is the same account for all Utah State stuff, so if you’ve registered your car online, you’ll use this same account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose to register a business, and you’ll be guided through a step-by-step process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll have to name your business.  There can’t be any name conflicts with other existing businesses, and I was shocked at how many businesses were already registered and how many different things I had to try to get something unique.  Once you find something and submit it, it goes off to the State, and I assume somebody manually checks it somewhere, but the process may take a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How you answer the rest of the questions will depend on how you want your business setup, and again, I’d recommend you talk to somebody who knows business and who knows law before you get too far.  But I can tell you what I chose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under &lt;em&gt;Declare the Business Entity&lt;/em&gt;, I chose LLC as the type, and Domestic as the sub-type.  I chose for it to be managed by a single member that was an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I got to the &lt;em&gt;Define the Ownership and Management&lt;/em&gt; section, I entered myself as the Member and the Registered Agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally under &lt;em&gt;Existing Account Information for this Business&lt;/em&gt; section, I put in the EIN that I got from step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3 - Get a bank account&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll need the EIN you got from step 1 when you go to your bank to open a business account as well.  I’d recommend that you put some money in that account up front, then take your business expenses out of this account.  Keeping separate bank accounts for your personal and business finances is a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to get a credit card for your business as well, but don’t be too surprised if you can’t get one right away.  Since your business has no history or credit history, credit institutions understandably have a bit of trepidation about giving you a credit card.  But I’ll try again in a year or so.  It would certainly make things a lot easier for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first post on this blog was in January of 2007, over 7 years ago.  At the time, I was in my final semester of graduate school, finishing up my Master’s degree.  I had a Professor (thanks Dr. Liddle) who for a class assignment told us to setup a blog and provide him the URL to the RSS feed so he could subscribe to it.  He would give us our homework assignments and we would finish them by finishing whatever research task he had set for us and writing a mini research paper of sorts as a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my first posts were about information architecture topics, web analytics topics, with some programming stuff mixed in.  But I found that I liked writing, so I wrote about stuff that was happening in my life as well and continued to do so after graduation.  At the time, I was also becoming familiar with Linux and liked doing web development as a (admittedly strange) hobby, and when I figured out something new after scouring the dark corners of the internet, I would post about it here, in the hopes that my research would save other people hours of effort some day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day, most of the modest amounts of traffic to my site are to these old posts - things like how to connect with root access to a MySQL database on a remote development machine, how to start subversion at boot on an Ubuntu server, and other geek stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The I've-Lost-My-Passion Phase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also known as the I’ve-Lost-My-Passion-But-Think-I-Should-Force-Myself-To-Blog-Because-It’s-Good-For-My-Career Phase.  As I got into my career, I had less and less time to do play around with this kind of stuff, and the intervals between posts got much longer.  I started to write more about Analytics and Marketing in an attempt to build my “personal brand”, but I was never really passionate about building a brand around that stuff, my heart wasn’t really in it.  Looking back, that particular effort seemed doomed from the start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that remained constant all this time in the back of my mind was my desire to do something on the side, to build a business that would generate some passive income.  I listened to and read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/&quot;&gt;Pat Flynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesaltucher.com/&quot;&gt;James Altucher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.asmartbear.com/&quot;&gt;Jason Cohen&lt;/a&gt;, and others.  I had a couple ideas that I thought were good ones and on a few occasions, attempted to bring groups of people together to pursue them, but either through fate, business, or laziness, none of them ever really got off the ground (my best idea you can see at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canistream.it/&quot;&gt;Can I Stream It&lt;/a&gt;, it just wasn’t me that built it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this period, most of my posts were about ideas that I had or technology related topics that I thought were interesting, but posts were sporadic at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The I-Think-I've-Got-My-Blog-Mojo-Back Phase&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to today.  The Internet has changed humanity in a fundamental way that anyone with an idea or something to say is almost guaranteed to find a way to to say it and find somebody to listen.  Sure, that means there’s a lot of noise, but it also means that spectacular ideas, inspirational tales, and deeply moving stories - all of which have the power to change the world - can come from anywhere.  What if one of those could be mine?  What if the things I know, the things I learn, or the things I do, have the power to impact other people in a positive way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was listening to Pat Flynn’s Smart Passive Income Podcast&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/author-empire-steve-scott/&quot;&gt; Episode 124&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevescottsite.com/&quot;&gt;Steve Scott &lt;/a&gt;was talking about his business of writing books.  A spark was lit within me.  I’ve always loved writing.  This was actually something I could do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Holy Crap, I'm Going To Write A Book!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So holy crap, I’m going to write a book!  This site is going to be about my journey to do it.  I have no experience writing books or selling books, so I’ll be figuring it out as I go along.  I’ve got some ideas about how to do it, but no idea if they’ll work.  Or how well they’ll work.  Or how well they won’t work.  But I’ve got a spark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Choose the path at the fork where your heart goes on fire. Go down that path.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to use this site as an outlet to describe the process.  How will I find my topic?  How will I write a book?  What skills do I need and tools and resources can help me develop them?  What challenges will I face?  How hard will I have to work? What sacrifices will need to be made?  How do I promote and market a book?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking about how to go out at the top, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2014/07/how-to-go-out-at-the-top/&quot;&gt;James Altucher said&lt;/a&gt;, “Choose the path at the fork where your heart goes on fire. Go down that path.”  That’s what I’m doing now.  I’ve spent a lot of time in my life telling people that I’m not creative, but don’t think that is true anymore.  I just always thought of creative people as artists that could draw or paint or sculpt.  I can’t do any of those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But writing is art too, and I can write.  So I invite you to come on this journey with me.  Because I think you can write too.  I think you have a story to tell.  And I want to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben</name></author><summary type="html">The Look-At-My-Shiny-My-Shiny-New-Blog Phase My first post on this blog was in January of 2007, over 7 years ago.  At the time, I was in my final semester of graduate school, finishing up my Master’s degree.  I had a Professor (thanks Dr. Liddle) who for a class assignment told us to setup a blog and provide him the URL to the RSS feed so he could subscribe to it.  He would give us our homework assignments and we would finish them by finishing whatever research task he had set for us and writing a mini research paper of sorts as a blog post.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cookie-sharing.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-382&quot; title=&quot;cookie sharing&quot; src=&quot;https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/cookie-sharing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the hype/concern/backlash/misinformation-fueled legislation in the world around cookies and their use in the browser, I think it’s only a matter of time before analytics and ad tech are going to have to figure out a non-cookie dependent solution for measuring web usage and delivering relevant ads to interested consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really a value proposition problem.  The consumer doesn’t see the value of sharing data, and rather than showing them the value, corporations have essentially tried to figure out ways to collect the consumer’s data anyway, just without letting them know about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here’s the straightforward and transparent plan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Convince a group of consumers to maintain a profile with accurate demographic &amp;amp; behavioral information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have the group create a list of things/categories they're interested in seeing ads/offers for&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Find a group of product makers who will divert some of their ridiculous marketing budgets into discounts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Play matchmaker between the interested consumers and the products being offered by product makers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sell the product to the interested consumer at a discount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consumer gets a great deal on the thing they already want/need.  The product maker sells the thing that they wanted to sell to an interested person and didn’t waste money telling 1M people at $10CPM that didn’t care about the thing they were selling.  An ongoing relationship is formed between the consumer and the product maker that provides value to both parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as the consumer remains interested in the category (as determined by their up to date profile), the product maker is free to continue to make offers to the consumer at the same discounted rate or normal pricing.  There would obviously be a pricing strategy - which I know nothing about - that would determine their ultimate offers to repeat customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone makes informed decisions, no one is tricked, and no regulated/illegal cookies are involved in the mutually beneficial transaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben</name></author><category term="cookies" /><category term="measure" /><summary type="html">This is the second time I’ve written this post.  The first time, I started to go into a huge explanation so that everyone could understand this idea before realizing that anyone who didn’t already understand the issues had a 0% chance of caring about the idea anyway.  So if you don’t know what I’m talking about, then this post is not for you.

&lt;p&gt;Often times, I sit down in the evening and wonder what I should watch.  I have a Netflix subscription, I can buy stuff Video on Demand from Amazon or from Apple.  Of course there’s access to Hulu and none of those is good enough, you can try Vudu or Crackle.  Or maybe I just want to watch something that I already own.  But I want to watch something funny with George Clooney in it.  Or maybe I I’m in the mood for an action movie with Angelina Jolie or that guy that plays Captain America.  I want to watch it in HD and I want to stream it, because I’m not waiting for the disc in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does Netflix have something I want?  Is it available for streaming?  Can’t find anything on Netflix (can anyone?), so let me go look at Apple.  Or Amazon.  Can I rent it?  Can I buy it?  Is it availble in HD?  Which one is cheaper?  By the time you’ve gone through all this, sometimes I’ve just decided it’s not worth the trouble.  So here’s the idea. A single site where I can punch in a title or an actor, and it will search all of these places for me.  I can filter the results down by streaming, by rent or buy, by HD quality, by price, by genre, by just about anything I want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I can click a link and go buy/rent/stream whatever I decided on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben</name></author><category term="amazon" /><category term="movies" /><category term="netflix" /><summary type="html">Often times, I sit down in the evening and wonder what I should watch.  I have a Netflix subscription, I can buy stuff Video on Demand from Amazon or from Apple.  Of course there’s access to Hulu and none of those is good enough, you can try Vudu or Crackle.  Or maybe I just want to watch something that I already own.  But I want to watch something funny with George Clooney in it.  Or maybe I I’m in the mood for an action movie with Angelina Jolie or that guy that plays Captain America.  I want to watch it in HD and I want to stream it, because I’m not waiting for the disc in the mail.

&lt;p&gt;Today, I setup a couple of WordPress plugins for automatically posting blog links to Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;WP to Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is &lt;a title=&quot;WP to Twitter Plugin&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-to-twitter/&quot;&gt;WP to Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.  Instructions are pretty straightforward for creating a Twitter app for integration.  Small hitch was that after creating my Access Token I had to reload the page in order for the access tokens to actually show up.  Now whenever I create a new post, it will post a Tweet using my Twitter account with a link back to my post.  Bit.ly integration is supported, WP tags are converted to Twitter hashtags and there are a few other options as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Add Link to Facebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second plugin is &lt;a title=&quot;Add Link to Facebook Plugin&quot; href=&quot;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/add-link-to-facebook/&quot;&gt;Add Link to Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.  The name of this one is somewhat of a misnomer because it does way more than just add links.  It appears to integrate blog comments and Facebook comments as well as a host of other features.  For now, I’m only planning on using it to post links, but I will probably explore some of the other features later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup for this one was a bit more complicated.  The plugin page has a setup guide as well as an FAQ.  When attempting to authorize the application within the WP setup, I kept getting a redirect_uri error on setup end eventually ended up deleting the plugin, deleting the Facebook app I had created and starting from scratch a second time.  The second time through creating the Facebook app I caught a message that said the app had been created, but could take “several minutes” to replicate across their servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to wait for awhile.  After 15 minutes or so, I was still receiving the error, so I went to play Legend of Zelda for awhile, and tried again an hour or so later.  This time, it went to Facebook and authorized just fine, and now I’m just playing with different settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben</name></author><summary type="html">Today, I setup a couple of WordPress plugins for automatically posting blog links to Facebook and Twitter.

&lt;p&gt;This idea stems from a &lt;a href=&quot;http://green.autoblog.com/2012/03/06/bob-lutz-gets-a-lesson-in-climate-change-science-from-neil-degr/&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; I read about global warming in which Bob Lutz (big car guy formerly of GM, Chrysler, Ford, and BMW) insists that it’s a bunch of garbage and a scientist named Neil deGrasse Tyson tells him he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Bob Lutz is not the only guy that insists it’s hokey, and Neil Tyson is not the only one saying it’s not.  From what I can tell, the argument largely falls upon party lines with conservatives saying it’s junk and liberals saying it’s not.  How are the moderates supposed to make up their minds?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today’s idea is this: a site that covers all the major topics of controversy with opinions from both (all?) sides of the issue represented.  The rules are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You have to use your real identity to participate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recognized experts in the field can post opinion pieces to represent the different viewpoints on the issue (limited to 2 pages, so you really have to distill your content to the bare bones)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Constructive comments are allowed on all primary opinions to encourage dialog&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Neutral moderators summarize the opinion pieces from the different sides&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Participants can choose a side to support and only then can they vote on the best arguments &amp;amp; supporting facts for that side (you can't downvote the opposition)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Issues are presented in a simple format with the summaries from all sides visible up front and you can dive into individual arguments from there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who have not yet formed their opinions now have a resource of information where they can go and read the best arguments from each side and make up their own minds.  It’s like a political kaleidoscope.  Single issue in focus and you can see all the different facets.  Maybe a diamond or gemstone would be a better analogy, but I really like this kaleidoscope picture.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Ben</name></author><category term="politics" /><category term="truth" /><summary type="html">This idea stems from a recent article I read about global warming in which Bob Lutz (big car guy formerly of GM, Chrysler, Ford, and BMW) insists that it’s a bunch of garbage and a scientist named Neil deGrasse Tyson tells him he doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
