<meta name="description" content="If you’ve been viewing my blog recently, you’ll now notice that the theme has changed and everything looks rather differently. There’s a good reason for this. I’ve now switched to Typo, a RubyOnRails powered blogging engine. I spent quite a bit of time evaluating a few different options, compared features, etc. I’ll post the results of that later, because I figure it might save many other folks hours of work, but for now, the important things is that for me the benefits of switching outweighed sticking with WordPress. I’ve no complaints about Wordpress, just love the extensibility of Rails and I know much more about Rails than I do about PHP. I even compared a few different Rails engines, but finally settled on Typo for many different reasons. This is really my first real migration from a development environment to a production environment on a web-host. I’ve done a lot of the programming for other sites, but the migration was always handled by someone more experienced than I. So after struggling with cross-platform database migrations, Apache setup, .htaccess files, config files, and many another unforeseeable issue, I’m ready to declare this one a success. As you poke around on the new site, you’ll probably notice a few strange looking things. “Double-quotes” and other things didn’t handle the migration as well, so it’ll take a little while to fix all those things, but it’ll get cleaned up before too long. For now, enjoy the new site." />
