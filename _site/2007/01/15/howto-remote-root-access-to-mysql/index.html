I don’t forward the port through my router and I use a very secure password (doesn’t everyone?).

<p>Very quickly, another thing that I typically like to do on my server boxes is allow root access to my Mysql database from remote computers.

<p><code>sudo apt-get install mysql-server</code></p>

<p>Ubuntu installs Mysql at /etc/mysql/ by default. Now we need to set a root password.</p>

<p><code>mysql -u root
mysql&gt; SET PASSWORD FOR 'ROOT'@'LOCALHOST"</code></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>= PASSWORD(‘new_password’);&lt;/code&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now while we’re still here, we’ll create a new HOST for root and allow root to login from anywhere.</p>

<p><code>mysql&gt; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%'</code></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’ WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql&gt; FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql&gt; exit&lt;/code&gt;</p>

<p>and comment it out. That’s all there is to it! Now get your favorite MySql client and start developing.</p>
