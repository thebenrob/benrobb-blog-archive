<meta name="description" content="This may not be news to anyone else, but it was a surprise to me when I ran into it, so I thought perhaps someone else might find it helpful. Let’s imagine that you’ve got a form with a textarea that allows for a decent amount of user input, like, say a blog post or a news item on your family website. When you push the “Enter” key it goes down to the next line. Behind the scenes, this is stored in your database as a new line character which is represented by “\n”. The problem is that “\n” has no meaning to a web browser. In web browser language, what you really need is a line break represented by the “&lt;br /&gt;” tag. So how do you get all your new lines to turn into line breaks? The answer is one simple method added to your application_helper.rb file in your Rails project. def line_break(string) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string.gsub(&quot;\n&quot;, &#39;&lt;br/&gt;&#39;) end Then in your view, you simply call the line_break method around the appropriate block of text &lt;%= line_break(@news.body) %&gt; and that’s all there is to it!" />

<p>When you push the “Enter” key it goes down to the next line.  Behind the scenes, this is stored in your database as a new line character which is represented by “\n”.

So how do you get all your new lines to turn into line breaks?  The answer is one simple method added to your application_helper.rb file in your Rails project.
<code>
def line_break(string)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;string.gsub("\n", '&lt;br/&gt;')
end

<p>Then in your view, you simply call the line_break method around the appropriate block of text

&lt;%= line_break(@news.body) %&gt;
