<meta name="description" content="It’s no secret that I’ve been lusting after the iPhone for awhile now.  I thought that the Touch was cool, but I’ve been really excited about having internet on a phone, being able to look at Google Maps while driving etc.  And I think it’s cool to have a real browser on the phone; one that works with the real internet (as opposed to the fake internet that’s made for those other phones with crappy browsers). Up until now, my excuse for really going after the phone was that it would mean that I didn’t have to carry my laptop around when I go places anymore.  With my church responsiblities, I need my calendar everywhere I go now, which translates into carrying around my 6 lb laptop all day on the weekends.  I use it for notes, my task list, and my calendar items. The iPod Touch had a calendar, task list (I think) but no notes.  And the calendar was not editable, meaning, I’d still have to carry around the laptop so I could put new appointments in.  Well the latest firmware update (1.1.2) now adds editable calendar items, which I think includes tasks, and notes will be available without jailbreaking in February when Apple releases the SDK.  As long as you’ve got a place with Wi-Fi though, there are already web apps that provide that functionality. Are you following my convoluted thought process?  I wanted the phone so badly that I was planning on dropping off my paid company phone plan and paying my own bill just so I could join AT &amp; T.  I think the Touch might be good enough to satisfy my techno-lust and is now really starting to look like the smarter option.  Plus for the same price, you get twice the storage space.  Can reason win out over my desire?  What are your thoughts?" />
