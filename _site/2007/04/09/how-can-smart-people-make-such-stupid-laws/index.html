<meta name="description" content="I found this article through Slashdot today, and I&#39;m embarrased to call myself a Utahn. Apparently our legislature has just passed a law that bans keyword advertising. Not all keyword advertising, just the ones that use something that could loosely be tied to a competitor&#39;s trademark. If you&#39;re in the same industry, couldn&#39;t any keyword fit that description? Apparently the law only applies if the ad is displayed in Utah or the advertiser/keyword vendor is located in Utah. How on Earth does one control that? In reality, every advertiser would have to check a Utah registry before buying keywords that might contain a trademark of a competitor. In fact, the language of the law is even more vague. It defines a trademark as an &quot;electronic registration mark...[a] word, term, or name that represents a business, goods, or a service.&quot; How does the state of Utah possibly expect to enforce this law? If all this doesn&#39;t spell S-T-U-P-I-D-I-T-Y, the law passed despite the fact that Utah&#39;s general counsel informed the legislature that the law violated the dormant commerce clause. The bills champion, Dan Eastman, is trying to protect against so-called trademark hijacking, which he refers to as a new form of identity theft. While that is a problem, this is one solution that will never work. The consitutional issues involved are only one massive obstacle in the road, not to mention the lack of support from anyone with a brain (OK, maybe that&#39;s a bit harsh). The likely outcome is that the law won&#39;t stand up under scrutiny or even a slight breeze, but before we can bury it, our tax dollars will have to pay for the litigation and resulting court cases so the judges can strike it down. Couldn&#39;t the state be doing something worthwhile with our money, like working on the new Real Salt Lake stadium?
