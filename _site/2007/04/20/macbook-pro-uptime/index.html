<meta name="description" content="Rebooting is standard procedure for nearly every computer I own or have ever owned.  I’ve noticed however that whenever I have to reboot my Mac, it makes me mildly angry.  I’ve become accustomed to running my six standard applications (Firefox, Mail, Adium, iCal, iTunes, and NetNewsWire Lite) all the time.  I literally never turn them off.  When my computer goes in my backpack, it’s sleeping and ready to go at a moment’s notice. Uptime is something that people usually are proud of when they talk about servers, but in my own little world, I started taking pride in my laptop uptime.  The latest security update from Apple forced me to restart my computer, but prior to that, I had achieved a short month of uptime. My father-in-law just announced his anger at Microsoft again, but this time it was enough that he wanted to go Mac.  Freezing and restarting is one of his major gripes.  When I shared this little screenshot with him he was stunned speechless." />
