<meta name="description" content="For those who read my blog, you’ve noticed I haven’t written for awhile.  Now that things are starting to settle down a bit following graduation and beginning a new job, I thought I’d venture back into the world of blogging. Now that I no longer have homework to do, my spare time has dramatically increased.  I spend more time at work than I ever spent at school, but the time is well spent and when I’m done working, I’m done for the day.  What will I do with all my leisure time? There are a few plans, but at the top of the list will be the creation of a new domain.  I’m going to move all my web analytics related content to a new domain (still to be decided upon).  Since all my rails work is centered around web development, that will go along with the web analytics stuff to make a new Rails/Web Development/Web Analytics/SEO Dabbling blog. This blog won’t be going anywhere, but it’s going to become more about me, my life, and my computer dabbling hobbies, wading into various *Nix distros and griping about software I don’t like.  So once I get the new site up and running, I’ll let you all know where my intelligent sounding posts are going, and this one will be for my rants and hobbies. I’m working at Omniture now, just got all my benefits papers filled out and submitted and looking forward to the completion of training so I can actually get to work.  This is going to be fun." />
