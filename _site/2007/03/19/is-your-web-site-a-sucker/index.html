Many have probably heard about Web Pages That Suck.  I think I first ran across it several years ago, but largely forgot about it.  A few months ago, I ran across it again.  Most of the content was new to me, so I looked through it and read a few of the articles.  If it’s late at night, or you’ve got a few geek friends crowded around, you’ll really get a kick out of the 10 Worst Web Pages in 2006. Some of the things that people are doing with their website are absolutely appalling in their horribleness (yes, I made that word up), but some of the other things that people do wrong are rather subtle, and I find myself falling into the traps sometimes. So, if you’re wondering how bad your web site sucks, you can head over to the checklists to analyze your own site.  Checklist 1 is a list of things that mean your website definitely sucks.  If you check a box, then your site sucks.  Checklist 2 is a kind of conglomerating thing.  It’s hard to tell how many of these you can check before your web site qualifies as a sucker.  After looking at the checklist, head on over to What do I do now? page to find out how to fix it. On a completely different note, my website seems to have finally made it into somebody’s spam index, and Akismet really earned it’s keep over the weekend." />
