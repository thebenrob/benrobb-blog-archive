<meta name="description" content="So after our the recent win at the Omniture Web Analytics competition, there was nothing set in stone, but several different Omniture employees (relatively high-ups) came around to talk to us and ask us if we had jobs. Again, nothing was settled, but they made it quite clear that they were hiring and they would be very interested in hiring any one of the team. Now As I’ve mentioned before, I’ve already signed with KPMG to go to Silicon Valley to work in their Contract Compliance Services group. I find myself in an interesting position. I originally began to look for employment outside of Utah because there just wasn’t much here in my field. It became clear that the bulk of opportunities lay elsewhere, and even though I didn’t really want to leave home (my family and my wife’s family are both nearby) I was OK with the idea, thinking that a few years down the road, we’d be coming back. The Omniture “offer” opens up a whole new world of possibilities. I know what the work at Omniture is like, and I know that I like it. It’s in a field that is very hot right now, but only in it’s infancy. I know that with some experience at Omniture under my belt, I would have a very marketable skill set that could be profitable at Omniture or just about anywhere else. What big company doesn’t want to improve it’s online marketing presence? At KPMG, after a few years, I’m marketable because I worked there, but I don’t know what my particular skill set would be. I wouldn’t have specialized in anything at all. I would have some experience managing teams to get jobs done, but I can get that at Omniture. In essence, I would be working so that I could get a name on my resume. I’ve been told that I would come out with marketable skills, but I don’t know what they would be, and honestly, I’ve got no idea what I would even be doing for them. So honestly, even though I’ve signed with KPMG, I’m seriously leaning towards Omniture. I will at least go through the application and interview process and see what turns up. My contract with KPMG is at will employment, and though I would have to refund my small signing bonus, it could definitely be worth the price. I have a few serious questions to ask of the folks at Omniture before I go work for them. I want to know about growth potential inside and outside the company. How quickly do I advance to positions of greater responsibility? How much does income increase and how often? What kind of benefits do they offer? Anyway, the decision is not made by any means, but I find myself in a situation I never expected to be in, faced with a decision that I never prepared myself to make. I’ve been soliciting advice from many people whose opinions I respect, so if you’ve got some input for the great debate, please let me know." />
