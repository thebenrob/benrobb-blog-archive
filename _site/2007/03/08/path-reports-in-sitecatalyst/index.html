<meta name="description" content="Another observation about the differences between Google Analytics and SiteCatalyst. Most visitors to my blog are single page visitors. This makes sense to me, since most of the people who read the blog regularly are subscribing to the feed, and they probably come directly to an article. Those who are googling in are landing in my How To pages, are staying for a decent duration (8-10 minutes in most cases, long enough to get the job done) and then bouncing out. Recently however, I&#39;ve noticed that the homepage itself has started to perform better relatively to the other pages on the site. And it has a much lower bounce rate (as homepages should). So then I got curious as to where people were going from the homepage if they weren&#39;t bouncing. That&#39;s when I noticed that Google Analytics has no path reports. SiteCatalyst has a pretty nifty feature called the Next Page and the Next Page Flow. It basically just shows the page you ran the report for, followed by the page that people visited next, and next again. It can also show you the entire path through the site that visitors are following, from entry to exit, and every page in between. I was talking to Matt Belkin from Omniture after our competition the other day, and he highlighted another important difference. I&#39;ve heard it said before, but with Matt the message came across quite clearly and simply. If you&#39;re not doing at least one million page views a month, SiteCatalyst probably won&#39;t be worth your money." />
