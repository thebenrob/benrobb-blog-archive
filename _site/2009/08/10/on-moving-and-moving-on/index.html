<meta name="description" content="For about 2 1/2 years now, I’ve been working at Omniture as a business consultant, helping companies to create measurement strategies, uncover optimization opportunities, and run their analytics programs. Besides the incredible amount of learning I’ve been able to do specifically related to the analytics field, I’ve also learned a lot about effectively managing my time, successfully managing my team, setting prioties, making estimates, setting deadlines, and in general, being a professional. For the past few months, I’ve been feeling like I’ve been on a plateau, doing the same kinds of things (and doing them well, after all, my work is my brand) repeatedly, but not really learning anything new or working on things I found particularly challenging.  In addition, I made some personal discoveries, and realized that the defined career path was headed in a direction that I really didn’t want to go.  I figured it was time to find a new path. I didn’t feel like leaving Omniture, I love the company, and I love the direction that we’re going, but I needed some new challenges.  I told my management that I was looking around and I started to branch out into my network within the company see what other opportunities might be available. I found one that fits my desires in all respects, and as of August 1st, I’m the new Manager of Market Insight.  More info coming soon." />
