<meta name="description" content="A few quick thoughts on yesterday’s primaries. It’s not secret that I’ve been supporting Mitt in my own small ways, but it’s been acknowledged many times that if you’re looking for a conservative who supports the three traditional conservative pillars, Mitt Romney is your man. Sure McCain is gobbling up lots of the independent votes, but the number of Republicans voting for McCain says one of two things: Either Americans in general are getting less conservative and care less about families, life, lower taxes, etc. or they’re (for some reason) willing to believe that McCain will not continue to do as he’s done in the past and thumb his nose at the conservative Republicans from whence his support comes. All the people voting for Huckabee says something a little worse. Though Huckabee staunchly refuses to accept the fact that his completely unexpected success yesterday represents anything but a resurgence in his bid for President, it’s now widely known that McCain was throwing his votes in the Huck direction in an effective (though below-the-belt) tactic to keep Romney from getting votes. Whether people don’t like Romney because he’s a Mormon, or because McCain’s palpable feelings of personal hatred towards Gov. Romney are contagious, it certainly seems that though the country is willing to elect it’s first woman president, or it’s first black president, the fear/misunderstanding of Mormonism has not been completely overcome. Prejudice works both ways and the incredibly strong showing at the Southern Polls shows a bit of prejudice in the opposite direction. Well, things look bad in the Mitt camp this morning, but what scares me the most is how divisive this has been for the party in general. I’ve heard many good conservative people voicing opinions that they’d rather vote for Hillary than McCain. There’s a scary thought." />
