<meta name="description" content="Or a U.S. job =) When two cables got caught, we chalk it up to coincidence. The third was a little strange, but still possibly explainable. When the fourth was cut, suspicions arose. Today, a 5th undersea cable was cut, and now it can only be explained by the super-secret government James-Bond-but-US-style agent. That’s my theory anyway. Five cut cables is a little too much to chalk up to coincidence and given the strategic location of the cuts, someone had something in mind, when they got out their industrial strength underwater internet cable cutters, climbed into their robot-armed submersible, and took it down a few thousand feet. No terrorists have no reason to cut internet access to their hidey-holes do they? It’s a guessing game of who would have a motive to do something like that. Maybe we (the US) are testing out new forms of warfare. Somebody in the Pentagon said “I know, let’s cut off their Internet access and maybe they’ll just give up.”" />
