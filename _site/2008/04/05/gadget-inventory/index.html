<meta name="description" content="I’ve been trying to find a local electronics recycler because all my old computer junk is just taking up too much space. When you get new electronics and toys, you’ve got to get rid of some of the old ones. This process made me realize just how many gadgets I’ve got. Here’s the current inventory that’s not on the recycle list: iPod Touch (current favorite) Macbook Pro (close second) AppleTV Mac Mini Dell 2407WFP 5th Gen Video iPod 2nd Gen iPod Nano (the one before the fatties) Nintendo Wii Dell Optiplex 745 Dell Optiplex GX150 Dell Inspiron 600m Blackberry Pearl Sharp Aquos 32inch 1080p LCD TV I wanted to get a new video card with this month’s allowance, but I realized that 2 of my 3 pairs of jeans now have holes in them and I better get some new ones before they rotted in tatters from my body. It was a little disappointing to realize that the video card would have to wait, but I made the right choice (I think) =) Clothes shopping has to be one of the most boring things in the world, but I figured I had to power through it. The trip to Target for jeans wasn’t a total loss though, because I was able to pick up Super Smash Bros Brawl for the Wii while I was there! Falcon Punch!!" />
