<p>Step 12: Decide that the AppleStore is too far away and opt for the UPS shipping option</p>

<p>Step 13: Ship it back to Apple</p>

<p>Step 14: Get an email from Apple that says they’ve determined that they won’t actually fix it or replace it after all (no word about the $300 that you spent for them to fix it)</p>

<p>Step 15: Have a long and frustrating conversation with AppleCare and find out that they won’t actually replace or repair anything unless every shard of the original glass is still in its original place</p>

<p>Step 16: Wait for your $500 lump of junk to come from Apple since they generously ship the unfixed iPad back to you</p>

<p>And that is how you turn your iPad2 into a $500 lump of junk.</p>
