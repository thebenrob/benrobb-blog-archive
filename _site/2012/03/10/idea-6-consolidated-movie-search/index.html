<meta name="description" content="Often times, I sit down in the evening and wonder what I should watch.  I have a Netflix subscription, I can buy stuff Video on Demand from Amazon or from Apple.  Of course there’s access to Hulu and none of those is good enough, you can try Vudu or Crackle.  Or maybe I just want to watch something that I already own.  But I want to watch something funny with George Clooney in it.  Or maybe I I’m in the mood for an action movie with Angelina Jolie or that guy that plays Captain America.  I want to watch it in HD and I want to stream it, because I’m not waiting for the disc in the mail. Does Netflix have something I want?  Is it available for streaming?  Can’t find anything on Netflix (can anyone?), so let me go look at Apple.  Or Amazon.  Can I rent it?  Can I buy it?  Is it availble in HD?  Which one is cheaper?  By the time you’ve gone through all this, sometimes I’ve just decided it’s not worth the trouble.  So here’s the idea. A single site where I can punch in a title or an actor, and it will search all of these places for me.  I can filter the results down by streaming, by rent or buy, by HD quality, by price, by genre, by just about anything I want. And then I can click a link and go buy/rent/stream whatever I decided on." />
