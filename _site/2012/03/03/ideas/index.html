<meta name="description" content="I’ve recently become slightly obsessed with the writing of James Altucher.  Brutal honesty, motivation, inspiration, and laughs all in one place.  Well, that and I want to be the luckiest guy on the planet.  He often talks about 4 pillars of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual in order to bring balance to our lives.  There’s a daily practice he recommends that touches on all 4 aspects, and I’m going to try it out. On the physical side, I already exercise fairly regularly, though I’ll need be more consistent.  Emotionally, I need to work on being more honest and on staying closer to people who lift me up and farther from people who drag me down.  On the spiritual side, I need to be better about prayer, meditation, gratitude, and forgiveness.  And on the mental side, I need to start thinking about ideas and writing them down. My idea muscle has been atrophying for years, so I’m going to start small and try to come up with one idea a day.  Most of these ideas are going to be ideas for businesses or services that should exist or ways to improve existing ones.  Oh, and most of them will be bad.  If you think any of them are any good, let me know and let’s work together =)    " />
