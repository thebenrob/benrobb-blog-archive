There are only a few shows that I want to watch.  Some I get from Netflix &amp; Hulu and some of it I do without.  I have a working (relatively) high speed internet connection. ESPN &amp; Microsoft, do a deal and give me access to your two channels worth of content on my XBox.  I’ll pay you $9.99/month for it.  Hey, I might even pay you $14.99/month.  That’s way more than either of you would make off me from Comcast if I was a subscriber and you were collecting a rev share.  I extend the same offer to Apple and Amazon.  Somebody help me out. Right now you’re not making any money off me and I’m not enjoying sporting events streamed over the Internet to my TV in high def.  Right now we’re both losing.  " />
