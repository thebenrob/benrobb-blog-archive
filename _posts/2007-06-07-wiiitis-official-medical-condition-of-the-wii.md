Just thought this was humorous enough to share with the world.  Well, at least to share it with the Wii fans.  <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSN0616721120070607" title="If it's not tennis elbow, it might be Wiiitis">Wiiitis</a> (pronounced we-eye-tis) was identified by Dr. Julio Bonis in a letter to the New England Journal of medicine.  Latin translation = inflammation of the Wii.  "The treatment consisted of ibuprofen for one week, as well as complete abstinence from playing Wii video games. The patient recovered fully."
