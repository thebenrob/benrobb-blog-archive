For those who attended the event, I imagine that Lance Armstrong's keynote and the Flight of the Concords performance will be top-of-mind and tip-of-tongue, but the keynote that really made me think about things belonged to Seth Godin.

First of all, his delivery is fantastic.  He's entertaining, he's funny, and he's spontaneous, but his subject matter is also fascinating.  He didn't talk about analytics.  He talked about how marketing is changing and how it's no longer enough for marketers to shout at people and expect them to listen.  We don't have to listen to marketers anymore, because we have so many other things we can pay attention too.

A marketers new role is to make a remarkable product.  He defined remarkable as something worthy of making a remark about.  That's all.  People talking about your product means people are spreading your idea.  Ideas that spread win.
