The article that prompts this post is <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/biggest-mistakes-in-web-design-1995-2015.html" title="Biggest Mistakes In Web Design">Biggest Mistakes in Web Design 1995-2015</a>.  If you're easily offended, this post may not be for you.  If the references to the quality of your web page doesn't offend you, Vincent's sense of humor may.  The article also serves as a decent index to the many articles he's written.

Many have probably heard about <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/" title="Web Pages That Suck">Web Pages That Suck</a>.  I think I first ran across it several years ago, but largely forgot about it.  A few months ago, I ran across it again.  Most of the content was new to me, so I looked through it and read a few of the articles.  If it's late at night, or you've got a few geek friends crowded around, you'll really get a kick out of the <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/10-worst-web-pages-featured-on-web-pages-that-suck-in-2006.html" title="10 worst web pages in 2006">10 Worst Web Pages in 2006</a>.

Some of the things that people are doing with their website are absolutely appalling in their horribleness (yes, I made that word up), but some of the other things that people do wrong are rather subtle, and I find myself falling into the traps sometimes.

So, if you're wondering how bad your web site sucks, you can head over to the checklists to analyze your own site.  <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/does-my-web-site-suck/does-my-web-site-suck-intro.html" title="Checklist 1">Checklist 1</a> is a list of things that mean your website definitely sucks.  If you check a box, then your site sucks.  <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/does-my-web-site-suck/does-my-web-site-suck-checklist-part-two.html" title="Checklist 2">Checklist 2</a> is a kind of conglomerating thing.  It's hard to tell how many of these you can check before your web site qualifies as a sucker.  After looking at the checklist, head on over to <a href="http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/does-my-web-site-suck/what-do-i-do-now.html" title="What do i do now?">What do I do now?</a> page to find out how to fix it.

On a completely different note, my website seems to have finally made it into somebody's spam index, and <a href="http://akismet.com/" title="akismet">Akismet</a> really earned it's keep over the weekend.
