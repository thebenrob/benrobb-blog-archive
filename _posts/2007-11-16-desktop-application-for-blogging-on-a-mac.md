I know that there are a few applications that do this.  I seem to recall looking at a few several months ago, but didn't feel like I had a big enough need that I wanted to pay for one.  Now that I'm looking to increase the frequency of my blogging, I thought it might be nice to give them another look.

Problem now is that I can't seem to remember any of the ones I looked at before, and I'm really drawing a Google Blank.  Any help from the masses?
