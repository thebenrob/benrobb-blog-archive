The OSI Model is the theoretical model that data communications are based on, but in reality, there aren’t really any real life technologies that follow the model particularly well. Here we’ll discuss how the OSI model maps to the TCP/IP stack.

Layer 1 - Physical Layer
Cabling, etc, anything that deals with the physical medium
It determines the type of signaling used, which ultimately determines your bandwidth

Devices: Hubs, cables, wireless signal, etc.

Layer 2 - Data Link Layer
CSMA/CD ?�?? Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection

Devices - Network bridge, switches,

Layer 3 - Network Layer
Networking and addressing

Devices: Routers

Layer 4 - Transport Layer
TCP is a stateful protocol meaning that it won’t transmit until it has a connection with a device at the other end
UDP is stateless meaning that it’ll transmit even if there isn’t anyone listening

TCP provides for error free-communications, which is the first time we can do this so far

Protocols: TCP/IP, UDP

Layer 5 - Session Layer
Establish and maintain a connection between two end points

Sessions in the TCP Stack are not at all related to HTTP Sessions

Layer 6 - Presentation Layer
This is where data is formatted an presented in a particular order.

Types: Jpg, Mpeg, mp3, etc

Layer 7 ?�?? Application Layer
Any of the services or applications running on your computer that need to use the network.

Layer 5, 6, & 7 are all mixed up in the TCP stack. In reality, the service or application using the network spans all three layers. Examples of protocols or services that span these three layers are FTP, HTTP, SMB, etc.
