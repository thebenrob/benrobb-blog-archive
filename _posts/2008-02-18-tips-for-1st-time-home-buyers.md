My father and my father-in-law have very different philosophies on money and how to spend it, but my risk averse nature means that I tend to play conservative when it comes to spending thousands of dollars at a time.

Alison and I are saving money to buy a home.  Alison shops around online and keeps an eye on prices in different neighborhoods around the valley.  I rule the monthly budget with an iron fist to make sure that a few hundred dollars goes into a house savings fund every month.  We've never bought a house before, and it'll be awhile before we can afford it, but for anyone who finds themselves in this situation, <a href="http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/12/18/advice-and-tips-for-first-time-homebuyers/" title="advice on buying a home">this article</a> at Get Rich Slowly offers some advice.

Some of my favorite tips are:
<ul>
	<li>Get pre-qualified for the mortgage and spend only 75% of that amount</li>
	<li>Make a list of priorities</li>
	<li>Buy less than you can afford</li>
</ul>
