<p>I've been contributing to <a href="http://ebusiness.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page">BYU's E-business Center Wiki </a> recently.  While my contributions may not amount to much, I found it to be rather engaging and strangely fulfilling.  Perhaps my knowledge can be of some use to others.</p>
<p>My recent contributions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Created the <a href="http://ebusiness.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> page</li>
	<li>Re-organized the <a href="http://ebusiness.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Growth_of_the_Internet">Growth of the Internet</a> page, and added the Current Trends section.</li>
	<li>Updated the stats on the <a href="http://ebusiness.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?title=The_Internet_Today">Internet Today</a> page</li>
	<li>Organized the <a href="http://ebusiness.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?title=XML_and_other_Markup_Languages">XML</a> page, added brief HTML and XHMTL data, as well as information about DTDs and links to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">w3c homepage</a></li>
	<li>Added a few resources to the <a href="http://ebusiness.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Web_Analytics_Resources">Web Analytics Resources</a> page</li>
	<li>Linked Wayne Perry's Edge Wireless address given on E-Business Day 2004, to the <a title="Mobile Phone Networks" href="http://ebusiness.byu.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Mobile_Phone_Networks">Mobile Phone Networks</a> page</li>
</ul>
<p>I found contributing to a professional-grade wiki to be an interesting experience when compared to a blog.  Wiki's should be written in a professional voice, leaving out "I", "we", and other first-person words.  While a blog is really just a narrative and the author has lots of freedom to write as they wish, wikis are a little more restrictive, simply because it's supposed to be professional grade.</p>
<p>The Wayne Perry address was interesting to watch again.  I actually remember attending his speech when he was on campus in 2004.  There are some fascinating statistics about cellular wireless technology, where its been, its explosive growth, and where its going, not only in the United States, but globally.</p>
