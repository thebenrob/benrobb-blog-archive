It's been awhile since I wrote anything related to Web Analytics.  I've been involved in a competition sponsored by Omniture where we pour over a sites data and figure out what recommendations we can make to the company's management to improve site and boost online revenue.  I can't say much since I signed a Non-Disclosure agreement, but it has certainly been interesting.

I ran across <a href="http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/362687/what-will-replace-the-page-impression.html" title="What Will Replace the Page Impression?">this article</a> and thought it was interesting in the context of what I'd been doing in the competition.  Anyone familiar with the way that web statistics are collected knows that there are issues with accuracy.  When spread over millions of visitors, the problems cease to be as significant, but they do exist.  The article highlights a few of the issues with some of the existing metrics and starts a discussion about what could replace some of the common ones that we use today.  I don't want to rehash everything here, but will point you to <a href="http://www.e-consultancy.com/news-blog/362687/what-will-replace-the-page-impression.html" title="What Will Replace the Page Impression?">What Will Replace the Page Impression?</a> if you're interested in some more reading.
