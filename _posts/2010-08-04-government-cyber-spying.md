There's nothing quite like asking a question to people who are not qualified to answer and publishing the answers in the news.

The latest I've come across is <a href="http://www.eweekeurope.co.uk/news/most-consumers-support-government-cyber-spying-8741">this article</a> which tells us that most consumers think it's OK for governments to hack, plant malware, and run DOS attacks on foreign governments.  No word on whether these same consumers think it's OK for foreign governments to do it to them, or where any government cares what consumers think.
