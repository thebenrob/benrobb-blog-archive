Can anyone tell me where to find it?  Does it even exist?

I've been looking for a good Rails host recently, one that's running Apache/Mongrel or something business class.  Apache mod_ruby was a terrible at best, FastCGI was better at handling threads and serving content, but now that we've got a native Ruby solution, that seems the best way to go.

But it's so expensive (at least for a personal blog).  I've looked at <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/" title="Media Temple">MediaTemple</a>, which looks like a great option, but the basic Ruby package is $20/month.  In the days of cheap hosts that seems quite a high monthly price.

Then there's <a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/" title="Hosting Rails">HostingRails</a> which has a basic Ruby package starting at $3.79/month, but if you want the Mongrel package, that'll cost you $9.79/month.  That's obviously a better deal, but they claim to be RoR developers since 2005 and their website would suggest otherwise.  It's not too badly designed, but I typically expect a much better look from a Rails developer.  It's just not the kinda place that I feel like I could trust with my credit card number.

So have I missed something?  What's the cheapest Mongrel-running host I can find out there?  Does HostMonster support Mongrel?  I know Bluehost doesn't.  Does anybody have experience with <a href="http://www.lunarpages.com/index.php" title="lunar pages">lunarpages</a>,  <a href="http://www.midphase.com/" title="midphase">MidPhase</a>, or <a href="http://www.anhosting.com/" title="an hosting">An</a>?  Please help me out in the comments below.
