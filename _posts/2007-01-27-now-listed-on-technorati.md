So now that I'm really starting to get serious about this whole blogging thing, I'm suddenly interested in driving traffic to my site.  I think this is partially a result of some of the things I'm learning in class.  In support of my efforts I'm now joining Technorati.  When I asked a friend about Technorati, he described it as "Google for Blogs."  With that kind of an endorsement, how can I resist?  With this in mind, you can now view my <a href="http://www.technorati.com/claim/ugdcsshmpm" rel="me">Technorati Profile</a>.
