Just a quick post on a topic that I found quite interesting.  Apparently Microsoft is working on software that will uniquely identify users based on their browsing habits.  It'll watch what websites you visit, how long you stay, etc., but could also potentially start sifting through your history to see where you've already been.

According to <a href="http://www.newscientisttech.com/article.ns?id=mg19426046.400&amp;feedId=being-human_rss20" title="New software can identify you">the article</a>,  right now it can guess age and gender fairly well, but there are very high hopes for it's future potential.  Online privacy advocates get your guns ready.
