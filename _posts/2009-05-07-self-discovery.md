I've been thinking a little bit about life lately, and how long we stay in different stages of it.  I've been part of the workforce for a few years now.  Looking back it seems like a long time, but looking forward I see that the entire span of my life so far will be repeated again before I retire (barring me striking oil, gold, or winning the lottery).

But having spent longer in my first real job than any other job I've had so far has caused me to start thinking about what the rest of my career looks like.  I've been exploring a few options for a month or so and discussions I've had with managers and potential managers have caused me to really start to zero in on the things I like to do and the things I would rather avoid. 

I love exploration and discovery, looking at different options, figuring out the best parts, and putting the pieces together to fit into a holistic solution.  When it comes to actually executing on my developed strategy, I start to lose interest.  I'm more of a thinker than an actual doer, but I'm convinced that it's OK to be this way and that the world can use more strategists.  More people like me.  The challenge now is finding the best opportunity that will let me think big...
