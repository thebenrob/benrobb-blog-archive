I ran across <a href="http://weblogs.hitwise.com/heather-hopkins/2007/03/what_is_the_optimal_balance_of.html" title="The right mix of Paid vs. Organic Search">this post</a> on Hitwise this morning, and the basic idea is that there is no perfect, optimal amount of paid search that applies to everyone.  It's different for industries, for companies within an industry, for the combination of keywords you want, etc.

I suppose if you stop to think about it, it makes intrinsic sense, but now we've got data to back it up.  The post has a few graphs to illustrate paid searches and click-through rates.  Hitwise collects and displays information mainly for the UK, but I want to know how they get access to all that data...
