I am a cord cutter.  Despite <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-cord-cutting-isnt-happening-the-pay-tv-business-is-growing-2012-3">this study</a> which says that cord cutting isn't happening, it is.  It may not be happening <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/en_masse"><em>en masse</em></a> (though I think the proper qualifier here is "yet"), but it is happening.  Though small, this number represents opportunity for content producers that has not been exploited.  It's being left alone because of the fear it would jeopardizing their existing revenue streams.  I understand why it hasn't happened, I'm just saying that as a consumer, I wish it would.

So here is my proposition, very clearly laid out for any and all takers.

There are only a few shows that I want to watch.  Some I get from Netflix &amp; Hulu and some of it I do without.  I have a working (relatively) high speed internet connection.

ESPN &amp; Microsoft, do a deal and give me access to your two channels worth of content on my XBox.  I'll pay you $9.99/month for it.  Hey, I might even pay you $14.99/month.  That's way more than either of you would make off me from Comcast if I was a subscriber and you were collecting a rev share.  I extend the same offer to Apple and Amazon.  Somebody help me out.

Right now you're not making any money off me and I'm not enjoying sporting events streamed over the Internet to my TV in high def.  Right now we're both losing.
