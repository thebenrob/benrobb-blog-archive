Apparently NewEgg.com now has OEM versions of Vista available for sale a few days ahead of the January 30 release date. Engadget has a little photo gallery and an article .

I got curious and ran the Vista Upgrade Advisor on my laptop at work. There was one screen in particular that caught my eye (click for the version that’s big enough to actually read).

This is the first side-by-side feature comparison that I’ve seen to date. My complaint is that they’ve divided up the feature set so strangely as to virtually force you to purchase the Ultimate Edition if you’re planning on using it for home use. No one wants to buy Vista without the Media Center stuff (for home use at least). Home Premium then seems like a nice option because it gives you just about everything including the much desired Media Center software. However the Home Premium Edition lacks Remote Desktop. For an average home user this is probably not a big deal, but any geek worth his salt is going to want Remote Desktop. The Business Edition is no good because it lacks the Media Center software, so that means we must go Ultimate.

When will that come available on the MSDNAA? I wouldn’t hold my breath.
