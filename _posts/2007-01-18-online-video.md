I find the term “viral marketing” interesting enough in it’s own right, but as I understand it, it certainly applies to online video. The term “viral” just seems to bring bad connotations to mind. Maybe it’s because a virus spreads by infecting, devouring, and eventually destroying it’s host, but I find it interesting that the frustrated marketers in attempts to shove more advertisements in your face have turned to “viral” tactics to achieve their goals.

A viral marketing campaign is considered a success when those who view the advertisements begin to market on their own. They tell their friends, family, and everyone that they know, and thus the marketer’s work is made much easier. The marketing message itself is considered the “virus” and the unknowing recipients are the unwitting hosts.

I suppose in reality it’s not as bleak as all that. The message must have some innate value – humor, importance, etc. – or the host won’t pass it on, and there are plenty of instances of failed attempts because the host organisms (us) didn’t like the virus.

I recently read a few articles about the phenomenon of online video and it’s contributions to marketing. As the television ceases to become the source of entertainment, more and more people turn to the internet with their leisure time. Marketers are seizing the opportunity to try to attract more users with entertaining online content. There were various examples in the articles, the overall feeling from the marketers was that putting video online is so cheap and simple that everyone should be doing it. This has lead to situations (in my opinion) where video is being used in places that it just doesn’t fit. Because of the BlendTec-type phenomenon, everyone is trying to find ways to use online video to begin these viral marketing campaigns, and I’ve seen a few that I feel are inevitably doomed to failure.
