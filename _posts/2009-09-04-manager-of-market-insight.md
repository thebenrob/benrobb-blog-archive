<p>Or Moving on Part 2 </p>  <p>I was waiting for one last thing to become public before I wrote this post, but it’s not happening as fast as I thought, so I’ll leave it out and catch you up later.</p>  <p>One of the things I discovered about myself is that I am a designer at heart.&#160; I love digging into a particular issue, understanding it from all angles, and brainstorming a solution.&#160; When it comes to discovery and exploration, that is where my interest and talents are.</p>  <p>I'm not particularly bad at implementing things, I just don't enjoy it as much, which means it doesn't receive my full attention, and I find myself looking for the next challenge.&#160; In the technology world, that always means I'm looking for the latest gadgets.&#160; In the business world, it means I like small teams where roles are ambiguous, job descriptions are in flux, and there's lots of changes to mix things up.</p>  <p>My new job has a little implementation and a lot of design.&#160; Perfect.</p>  <p>In a nutshell, my job has three main responsibilities.&#160; First, I've inherited and now own the Omniture implementation inside of the Omniture suite, measuring how our customers are actually using our applications (very much like an Omniture customer would measure how their users are using the website).&#160; The current design was created during a day where everything was pretty much web-based.&#160; It's been extended a bit and we've got more mileage out of it than was ever intended, but it's time to rethink a few things in an Omniture world that's expanding beyond the web.</p>  <p>Second, I believe all companies struggle with data in silos.&#160; Omniture has gone to great lengths to build a foundation where data is shared, and I'll be working to define behavioral metrics, integrate them with the flow of information, and get them into the hands of decision makers.</p>  <p>Finally, I belong to a team known as the Emerging Business team.&#160; This is a small team of extremely bright folks that are looking for new business opportunities.&#160; They liaise closely with the business development team exploring technologies, running Proofs of Concept with customers, and various other things to see if new developments in the industry (online or off) could be a viable business.&#160; The tie for me is that we hope to glean some insight into the trends taking place in the market provide some extra direction for out efforts.&#160; And there are a few things I'm looking into myself.</p>  <p>So that's the run-down.&#160; Some of it I know I'm good at, some of it is completely new.&#160; All of it is challenging and extremely interesting.&#160; Success is defined very differently with long-term objectives and lots of rope to go with it.&#160; But I believe I'm up to the challenges and I plan on giving it my best effort.</p>
