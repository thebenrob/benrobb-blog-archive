My wife bought me a bunch of Foo Fighter's CDs for my birthday.  When I get CD's I promptly rip them to mp3 and throw them in a box, never to see them again, but for some reason I still would rather have the actual CD instead of buying it on iTunes.  Anyway, this one threw me for a loop when I popped it in:

<img class="size-full wp-image-208 alignnone" title="CD Lookup Results" src="https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/foo_bolton.png" alt="CD Lookup Results" width="515" height="312" />

Obviously it's not a Michael Bolton CD, so I chose the Foo Fighters and then was greeted by this screen:

<img class="size-full wp-image-207 alignnone" title="When A Man Loves A Woman" src="https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/bolton_foo.png" alt="When A Man Loves A Woman" width="337" height="225" />

It all looked fine until I got to Track 7, and then I started to get a little worried.  Fortunately, this CD was not a mix of Foo Fighters and Michael Bolton and all I had to do was manually rename the tracks.  CD Lookup Fail!
