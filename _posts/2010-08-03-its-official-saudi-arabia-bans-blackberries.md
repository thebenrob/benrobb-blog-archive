So the government of Saudi Arabia is banning Blackberry devices in their country on the grounds that they are too secure and the government cannot read everyone's email.

This follows in the footsteps of the United Arab Emirates who did the same thing a week or so ago.

Call me crazy, but if I'm a company looking to secure my communications, isn't this a good thing? Â Maybe it's a RIM marketing stunt =)

<strong>Update</strong>

Apparently, it's not that our own government is comfortable with not being able to read Blackberry emails, it's just that they're better at breaking the encryption? <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67246V20100803">http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67246V20100803</a>
