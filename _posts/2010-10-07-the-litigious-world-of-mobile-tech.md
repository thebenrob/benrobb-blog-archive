Click through to see a chart illustrating all the currently ongoing lawsuits.  This is the second chart I've seen like this, but this one is easier to read.  It shows the relationships between all the companies suing each other over patents related to mobile devices.  Direction of the arrow indicates who is suing and who's being sued.

Nokia seems to be the hub, followed by Apple.  Nokia is suing everyone (and their dog) while Apple is being sued by everyone (and their dog).  Surprisingly Kodak seems to be overly litigious and conspicuously absent from everything is Palm (now HP) who has yet to sue or be sued by anyone at all.
