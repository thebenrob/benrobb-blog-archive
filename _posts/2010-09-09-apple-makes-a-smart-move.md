This morning Apple announced that they're lifting some of the restrictions that they had placed earlier this year on developers and the tools they use to create applications.

They also announced that they're going to publish official app review guidelines so that developers will have a much better idea of whether they're app will pass the review process or not.

Both are smart moves.  They'll benefit the development community and, by extension, the platform in general.  I'd like to think that they listened to their developers and that the FTC investigation had nothing to do with it, but the announcement is mum on that particular subject.
