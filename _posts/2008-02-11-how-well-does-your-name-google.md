So if you’re anything like me, from time to time you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ben+robison" title="ben robison">google your name</a>.  I like to see how many of the top 10 results are actually me.  Since I started doing this a year or two ago, I simply cannot compete with <a href="http://benjaminrobison.com/" title="benjamin robison">Benjamin Robison</a> the apparently famous violinist.  Though my blog gets a fair amount of traffic, I can’t make any headway against him.

Next in line is Ben Robison the director of an aircraft carrier fleet and then third on the list is me.  Then you’ll find a link to Ardesco’s site and find out that Benjamin Robison the violinist is also a director (no wonder I can’t top him).

Then there’s the Blue Dwarf’s blog talking about <a href="http://bluedwarfsblog.blogspot.com/2008/01/my-thoughts-on-ben-robisons.html" title="blue dwarf">my visit</a> to the Web Analytics class at BYU.  Whoever the Blue Dwarf is, he must be an SEO expert, cause my name is only on that page one time, and I was surprised to see it ranked so high.

The there’s <a href="http://island.byu.edu" title="BYU - IS Land">ISLand</a> where my blog gets resyndicated, followed by a few more blogs mentioning Ben Robisons that aren’t me.  And finally <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/benrobison" title="ben robison">my LinkedIn profile</a> rounds out the top 10.

So that gives me 40% of the top 10.  Not too bad, I thought until I googled my <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=bryan+niven" title="bryan niven">neighbor’s name</a> just for fun.  Dang Him!  All top 10 results are relevant to him.  Sure he’s got his own photography business.  Sure Apple has spotlighted his work.  Sure he’s got movies about him on YouTube.  Sure his <a href="http://www.josephreps.com/bn.html)" title="joseph reps">photography rep</a> links to him.  But does that make him more special than me =)

Anybody want to make popular movies about me and post them on YouTube?  No takers?!
