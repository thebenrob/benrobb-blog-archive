Just a quick announcement.  Today we celebrated the 1st birthday of my little girl Abby (Little Robison #1).  Since both families were together (for only the third time since Alison and I got married 3 1/2 years ago) we decided it was the ideal time to announce that we've got another little one coming in June 2008.

I hate answering the question, but people ask anyway, so to save you the time, yes, it was planned =)  Now that it's actually happening there's been some talk along the lines of "What were we thinking?" but ready or not, it's coming in June.
