<p>Awhile ago Matt Belkin wrote about <a href="http://www.omniture.com/blog/node/26" title="The Dark Side of A/B Testing">A/B Testing</a> and mistakes you should avoid while doing it (recommend reading for the online marketer in you).  He talked about the differences between A/B Testing and Multivariate testing.</p>
<p>Multivariate testing is changing more than one thing at a time.  True A/B testing takes discipline and patience, neither are often prominent character traits of web developers.  <a href="http://services.google.com/websiteoptimizer/">Google Website Optimizer</a> to the rescue.</p>
<p>From the homepage of the latest Google service: "Website Optimizer, Google's free multivariate testing application, helps online marketers increase visitor conversion rates and overall visitor satisfaction by continually testing different combinations of site content (text and images)."</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>
