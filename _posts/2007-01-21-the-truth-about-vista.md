A professor of mine shared this story and I had to pass it on:

“Today I had to drop by a local computer store and get, of all things, a floppy drive. Anyway while I was standing in this long, very slow line I overheard the computer expert at the counter say that Vista should be good, "because it is Unix based." Well there you have it, the evil empire has seen the light and the universe's imbalances have been mended since Windows is now based on Unix. I almost fell on the floor laughing. When I got up to the counter I told the guy "that was a funny one." Well unbeknownst to me, he was serious. So to straighten him out I told him that he was only partially correct, the only similarities between Windows and Unix was that they use the same ball bearings.”
