So yes, this pleases me.  I've noted <a href="https://benrobb.com/2010/08/11/the-case-against-net-neutrality/">before</a> that I love the idea of net neutrality, but I'm not willing to let the government regulate one more aspect of my life in order to make it a reality.  Apparently the nation agrees with me.

I do, however, find it funny that things like this can sway elections and public opinion, when you read the details and find out the the poll was based on 800 people.  That's 0.00026% of the population if you were wondering.
