For all those who come here looking for SiteCatalyst related information, I highly recommend you follow Adam Greco's blog, <a href="http://www.the-omni-man.com/" target="_blank">the Omni Man</a>.  Adam worked in the industry for many years as a SiteCatalyst customer, then worked for Omniture for a few years, and now he's back out in the industry.  His blog is dedicated to helping people get more from the Omniture tools they've got.  He's got one-of-a-kind insight into actually using SiteCatalyst because he's got the view from the outside in and the inside out.

My own (very basic) implementation of SiteCatalyst tells me that variations on "Site Catalyst" are my most popular internal search terms, and since I don't write much on the topic anymore, you may find some value in what Adam is writing.
