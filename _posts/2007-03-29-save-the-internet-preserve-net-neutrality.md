I've added a new link in the Links section and thought it was important enough to explain why.

Up until now, the internet has been a neutral playground.  Anyone could post content of any type, but your internet service provider probably does not want this to continue.  Most ISPs are now trying to prioritize content into different categories and make you pay  more if you want to access certain kinds.

Are you a YouTube fan?  Well, they could throttle back the bandwidth on streaming video unless you're willing to pay extra.  Same goes for music, or anything else you might be looking at.

This is a bad thing for all those web loving people in the world.  The web is the great leveler of today's society.  Everyone competes in a common arena, with no one being more special than another.  The smallest blogger in the smallest corner of the web is free to publish ideas and make his voice heard.

I'm not the expert, but I know where I stand.  Google <a href="http://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html" title="Google supports net neutrality">has explained it</a> better than I can.  Google supports net neutrality.  <a href="http://www.futureofmusic.org/rockthenet/index.cfm" title="Rock The Net">RockTheNet</a> is a coalition of bands and musical artists that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/internet/03/28/internet.music.ap/index.html" title="Keep the web neutral">support net neutrality</a>.  As always you can find out more on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_neutrality" title="wikipedia: net neutrality">Wikipedia</a>.

There is a vote coming this May in congress that will decide the future of the web as we know it.  Will it remain neutral?  Visit <a href="http://savetheinternet.com" title="Save The Internet">http://SaveTheInternet.com</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/help/netneutrality.html" title="Net Neutrality">Google's Net Neutrality</a> page to find out what you can do to make your voice heard and help save the internet.
