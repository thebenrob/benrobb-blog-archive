You know, regardless of your personal religious feelings and whether or not you believe in Microsoft, you've got to admit that they make a pretty good product.  I'm an Apple fanboy, but I do live in reality, and I can see that Windows helps make the world move along.  I can love my own operating system without hating all others.  There is room in my heart for those who choose to follow <strike>Satan's</strike> Bill's path.

That being said, every once in a while, I run across something that makes me wonder.  On my computer at work today, I was using Windows Live Messenger (formerly MSN Messenger) to talk to a friend when I saw this cleverly worded advertisement at the bottom of my Messenger window.

Is there really anything else to say?  Somebody in the marketing department had a bad day I guess.
