I'm fond of telling my wife that computers only do what you tell them to, but twice in the last week, my work laptop proved me wrong.

Last week, the wireless device suddenly disappeared.  It wasn't in the Device Manager, it wasn't in my Network Connections Properties window, it wasn't anywhere.  I didn't tell it to disappear.  A few days later, it came back, but had lost it's driver, so I had to go to the Dell Support site and download the wireless driver, which also installs an application, which I hate, but I need wireles.

Then, the first day back in the office after Summit, I undocked my laptop for a meeting and when I redocked it, the video completely crashed and I had to reboot.  I didn't tell it to do that either.  And then when I rebooted my Windows profile was corrupted, and then when it was all finally working again, this picture sums it all up nicely.

I'm no good at Photoshop, so you know it's true =)
