In my search for quality analytics blogs, I apparently missed one that produced a rather interesting article about Google Analytics being a quantum leap above any other analytics products on the market.  So while I work on finding the time to create my own analytics blog, I thought I'd post this up here for a little entertainment.

I found the original post <a href="http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/15823.asp" title="Google's Killer App">here</a>, when Eric Peterson of the Web Analytics Demystified blog ran <a href="http://blog.webanalyticsdemystified.com/weblog/2007/08/is-google-analytics-the-killer-app-no.html" title="Is Google Analytics The Killer App?">the refutation</a>.  I'm not in the business of copying content, so I'll let you read the posts for yourselves. Hope you enjoy the strangeness as much as I did.  Mom, you won't enjoy this one =)
