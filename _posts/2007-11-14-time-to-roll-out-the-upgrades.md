Just upgraded wordpress to the latest version.  It was a little more involved than I liked, but once I got the latest version of my theme, then everything went off without a hitch.  Now I've got database backups and code lying all over my desktop, but that'll all be cleaned up in short order.

I'm excited for this version of Wordpress however, since it now has native support for tags.  This is something that has been in Typo for ages, but the lack of a really good/cheap Rails host (well, maybe it's laziness and lack of willingness to try different hosts) means that I had to wait for Wordpress to include it before I could use it.

Yes, there were plugins before, but I try to keep the mgmt of my site to a minimum, and stay out of the code as much as possible.  I consider myself fully capable of diving into the code and the hardcore database stuff, but when you've got better things to do, why spend the time doing it?
