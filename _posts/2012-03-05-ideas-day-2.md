I tweeted this a day or two ago, but I'm annoyed by it enough that I'll post it here.  I've recently been the victim of a Blogger to WP migration on <a href="http://www.favfamilyrecipes.com">another site</a> I help out with, that was not under my control.  Dates were not transferred over correctly, slugs were not duplicated (necessitating manual slug editing on the last 5 years of content), images where not transferred so they're still coming from somewhere in the Google cloud, etc.

So idea #2 is: A smooth process for migrating from Blogger to Wordpress.
