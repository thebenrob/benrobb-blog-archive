A while ago, I wrote about gSyncIt which <a title="the old solution that didn't work" href="https://benrobb.com/2007/11/16/howto-outlook-plays-nice-with-gcal-thanks-to-gsyncit/">syncs</a> your Outlook Calendars to Google Calendar.  After playing with the free/trial version, I ran into a few problems.  I worked with it for 1 week or so, but when syncing (which was quite slow) constantly ran into problems with object references pointing to null objects.

It was the same calendar item each time and even though I had my settings to continue syncing on failure, that didn't happen, so I couldn't get my whole calendar to sync anymore.  A friend at work has  been using <a title="Calendar Synchronization" href="http://www.syncmycal.com/">SyncMyCal</a> quite successfully for awhile, so I finally went that route.  Even though it is $15 more than the $10 gSyncIt, I figured the price was still nice to get my calendars synched without having to deal with errors all the time.  I want my technology to work and get out of my way.

Not 20 minutes after making my purchase and registering SyncMyCal, I talked to another friend here at work who has been using <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/info">Plaxo</a> to sync his contacts and calendars with Google.  Plaxo is Free.  Buyer's Remorse sets in.

In addition to syncing your calendars and contacts between <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/info/corp">every conceivable operating system and program</a>, Plaxo is also integrated with a number of web applications most notably for me, Last.fm, Flickr, del.icio.us, etc.

After waiting for 4 weeks to make my purchase, why couldn't I have waited for another 30 minutes?  Buyer's Remorse.
