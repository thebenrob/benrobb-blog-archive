Me!  Today I accepted an invitation to serve as a judge in the finals round of this semester's analytics competition at BYU.  It'll be my first time back on campus since graduating last April and starting my work for Omniture.

My team won the competition during the Winter 2007 semester (the winnings funded my Wii) and one result of that was my eventual offer to work as a Business Consultant for Omniture Consulting.  I have been working there for just over 6 months now, and Matt Belkin thought it would be neat if I showed up as a judge in the finals, asking all the hard questions now that I've got a little experience under my belt.

Matt Belkin, Cam Barnes, and I will be judging the finals this Friday, November 9th.  I'm definitely looking forward to the opportunity!
