I signed up for the Web Analytics class under a strange set of circumstances. I really wanted to take a class that had some web content. Being a web developer by hobby, I thought it would be fun to take a web-related class that might perhaps give me an excuse to spend excess amounts of time on things that I actually enjoy (as opposed to many other classes I take that I do not enjoy).

Due to some scheduling mix-ups (which I feel are neither fair nor just, but now is not the time) the Web Development class was cancelled, the administration informed me that I was not allowed to take the Web Consulting class, and I couldn’t even audit the Web Analytics class - which I had arranged to do - because it was taught at the same time as another class that was required by the department (which previously had not been required).

After visiting with the administration, we were able to compromise and I ended up taking Web Analytics as a substitute for the “required” Mgmt Consulting class.

Thus, I should be pretty easy to please. As previously mentioned, web development is a hobby of mine, particularly as it deals with Ruby on Rails. I like programming web applications/sites/pages/things simply for the fun and for the challenge and have little or no interest in whether or not the world sees value in my work. I don’t do it for them, I do it for me.

I took Web Analytics to learn more about the web. The fact that it requires learning some new technologies is only a bonus, and I look forward to experimenting and playing with these technologies with great pleasure. I recognize that other students have expertise in these areas, and I’m looking to soak up knowledge from any source. This is my goal.
