 <p>I'm not the most creative person in the world, but every once in awhile I try. We were carving pumpkins for family night on Monday and I was trying to think of something besides the regular old triangle-nose-smiley-face-with-two-teeth pumpkin. Alison suggested I do the cube. She was referring to the weighted companion cube from a game called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)" target="_blank" title="Portal on Wikipedia">Portal</a> in which you weave your way through levels of physics puzzles with your portal gun and anything else that comes to hand.</p> <p>The weighted companion cube is one of the objects you use to get through one of the later levels and has a hilarious back-story to it. Anyway, here's what the cube looks like.</p> <p><img src="https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/companion_cube.jpg" alt="companion_cube.jpg" height="233" width="252"/></p> <p>And here's my initial drawing on paper (Mr. Turner my 7th grade art teacher who often caught me tracing should be proud).</p> <p><img src="https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/draft_cube.jpg" alt="draft-cube.jpg" height="560" width="415"/></p> <p>Here it is on the pumpkin after cutting the outline. Pretty happy with it at this point.</p> <p><img src="https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cutout_cube.jpg" alt="cutout-cube.jpg" height="639" width="478"/></p> <p>And the finished product. Not quite as impressive as I'd hoped, but maybe someone out there can appreciate it.</p> <p><img src="https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/cube_o_lantern.jpg" alt="cube-o-lantern.jpg" height="617" width="459"/></p>
