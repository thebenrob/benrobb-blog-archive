At a recent computer software engineering seminar, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:

“If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?”

Only one man sat motionless among the ensuing forest of raised hands.

When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team’s software, he said, the plane was unlikely to taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off.
