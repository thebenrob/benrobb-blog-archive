<p>SSH + Socks + (Firefox + FoxyProxy) = Browsing Freedom</p>
<p>Although tunnel through them would be a more accurate description.  I hesitate whether to post this or not, but the little wanna-be-hacker inside me is making me do it.  If you find your browsing is constrained by filters, proxies, or any other kind of unwanted restraints and you've got a spare offsite SSH Server, there is <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/ssh/geek-to-live--encrypt-your-web-browsing-session-with-an-ssh-socks-proxy-237227.php" title="Geek To Live">a solution to all your problems</a>.</p>
<p>The information is not new at all, nor is it complicated, it's simply combining technologies that most geeks already know about to achieve a result that makes me grin.  Take this information for what it's worth.</p>
<p>SSH is the popular Secure SHell program.  Socks is a kind of internet proxy that uses an SSH connection as a proxy.  FoxyProxy is a firefox extension that enables proxies on a per site basis.</p>
<p>That's all I'm going to say.</p>
