<p>None of this is original, I just uncovered <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2004/10/beware_the_ceo_.html" title="Beware The CEO Blog">this article</a> in the archives of the internet.  It answers the question I've been pondering for awhile, and it also cautions against something I've been thinking of doing lately (no I'm not a CEO).</p>
<p>The bottom line is this.  If you're a blogger and you expect people to read your blog, you must have 4 of the following 5 things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Candor</li>
<li>Urgency</li>
<li>Timeliness</li>
<li>Pithiness</li>
<li>Controversy</li>
</ol>
<p>I had to look up <a href="http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=pithiness" title="pithiness">pithiness</a> and this blog definitely doesn't have that.  To that Seth adds a 6th, for the sake of having a 6th.  Utility.</p>
<p>I'll add Familiarity as #7 on the list.  If you've got some kind of personal connection to the blogger, that'll keep you coming back.  I assume that's why most of you read my blog right?</p>
