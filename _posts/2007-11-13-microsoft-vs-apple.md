Just had an interesting experience that I found mildly humourous.  Maybe I'm a little cynical about Microsoft at the moment (I just read a <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/11/13/road_to_office_2008_installation_and_interface.html&amp;page=1" title="Road to Office 2008">negative review</a> for Office for Mac 08 at AppleInsider) but I thought I'd share a story about attention to detail.

I just noticed that the clock on my XP machine was an hour behind.  Having just passed daylight savings time a week ago, I make the assumption that it hasn't yet reset itself.  So I open the properties box and make sure it's set to automatically retrieve time from time.windows.com.  It was.  I forced the time sync, waited for about 45 seconds and was told that it couldn't sync to that time server.

I opened System Preferences on my Macbook, to see what time server it synced to.  I switched my XP box to sync to time.apple.com, it immediately refreshed and now my clock tells correct time.  I'll let you draw your own conclusions =)
