<img src="https://benrobb.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/sitecatalyst.thumbnail.png" alt="SiteCatalyst" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="5" />Working at Omniture means that I have fairly easy access to SiteCatalyst.  I've been running Google Analytics on my blog for over a year now, and I'm nearing my one year anniversary of starting at Omniture (April).  I figured it's probably time for me to take my own medicine.

I haven't done any real programming since leaving school and even then it was Rails or Java.  I've dabbled in PHP, but I've never done JavaScript.  Ever.  Turns out that programming languages are just programming languages.  The logic is the same and the syntax is all that changes (this is obviously gross oversimplification, but served my purposes tonight).  I looked at the JavaScript on a few of other sites and whipped up my own solution for naming pages and recording internal search terms.

Now there's no QC department on my MacBook Pro, but I spent about 45 minutes to code, debug, and test my implementation.
