I started in 7th grade with QBasic. That was about the limit of programming options at my Junior High school, so that put an end to computing until I got into High School. I took a programming class in high school, but it was the first semester that Java was being taught, and the teacher himself didn’t know anything about Java. This translated into being given source code, told to change the variables, and hand it back in. As long as we maintained an ‘A’ in the class, we had access to the O:\drive which was the gaming drive. Once a week we would download our teacher’s source code, find/replace the variables, and then play Quake II for the rest of the week. Sadly, this was OK with our teacher.

Thus, upon returning from my mission I signed up for CS 142, a supposed entry-level Java programming class. It was not required for anything, I just thought it might be fun to actually learn how to do some programming, since after two classes I still didn’t know anything. After being accepted to the Isys core, I did the standard two semesters of Java programming, accepted a position as TA for next year’s core, and ran off for the summer to program with Ruby on Rails. My familiarity with the MVC framework (learned in the core) earned me my summer position, although I made it clear to my employers that I knew nothing about Ruby or Rails.

That summer, I fell in love with the sweet simplicity of Rails development. So simple! The intelligent mapping of controller to view. The MVC. The ActiveRecord class. No getters, no setters, no beans. It was almost depressing to end the summer, and take up my post as Isys 403/413 TA teaching Java again. I had no time to develop in Rails anymore, and for the next 1.5 years, it fell by the wayside, only to be recently revived over the 2006-2007 Christmas break when I dove back in.

I currently work as a jack-of-all-trades for the Financial Solutions Dept., a subgroup of the Financial Services group on campus. I’ve developed a few basic PHP applications, but had to figure out many things in the process.

I’ve picked up bits and pieces of different programming languages as I began to discover things on my own. I know a little about VBScript, and some of the enterprise management things you can do with it. Experimentation with Linux has given me an intermediate understanding of the operating system, and a working knowledge of VI (Ubuntu is my favorite distro)

So what can I do? Ruby, Ruby on Rails, CSS, HTML, XHMTL, Java, JSP, PHP, PHP on Trax (rails clone for php), and MVC. I’m also familiar with Joomla!, Wordpress, and Documentum (although I don’t like it much). What can’t I do? Javascript (it’s on the list), AJAX (also on the list).
