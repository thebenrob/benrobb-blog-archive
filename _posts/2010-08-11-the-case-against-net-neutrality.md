I'm going to go ahead and say it.  I'm against Net Neutrality.

I love the concept.  I'd love all content to have equal access to internet pipes, but I don't want that to be enforced by laws and a governmental morass of regulation and legislation.

If you can achieve the same thing through a gentlemen's agreement, then it'll be a thing of beauty, but I think this is one thing the government shouldn't have their hands in (there are others, but let's stay on topic).

Just because I don't like something doesn't mean I should go crying to the government in to solve the problem.  When I was a kid we had a word for people that always appealed to a higher authority when facing a problem.  We called them tattle-tales.
